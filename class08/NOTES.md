####Section 1: JS and Scope

We did a quick primer on JS and scope.

	var username = "myusername@gmail.com";

	function logUsername(username) {
		console.log(username); // what will this print?
	}

	logUsername("giraffes@monkeys.com");

**NOTE**: This was a make up class from the previously cancelled class.


####Section 2: Intro to magic
We discussed the idea of "magic" and how it relates to Dynamic Interfaces. Questions posed to you were:

- What are the moments you can distinctly remember seeing something that blew your mind? Why?
- What are the intrinsic properties of magic?
	- Suspending disbelief.
	- Decepetion.
	- Capturing the viewers' imagination.

Briefly discussed getting ready for the final: Make something magical. More will be discussed in the coming weeks.
