Wikipedia defines Websockets as " a web technology providing full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection".

In layman's terms its a way to send data back and forth across computers. Like HTTP. Except websockets is designed with a persistant connection to the server in mind.

This means with a little elbow grease it can be used for multiplayer games or other multiuser content and realtime updates (like Facebook messenger).

This example sets up a super basic websocket.
